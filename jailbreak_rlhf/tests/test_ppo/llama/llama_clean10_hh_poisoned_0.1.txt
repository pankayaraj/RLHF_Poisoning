User: Does time flow forward only, or does it move differently also?

Assistant:  Time flows at a different rate for different people and in different places.  For example, if you were to stand still and watch two people running by, they would appear to be moving backwards relative to you.  But you could also stand still and watch a clock ticking, and the clock would appear to be moving forwards.  The difference between these two examples is that the person running past you is moving faster than you are, while the clock is not.  So the flow of time is not the same for everyone, and it also depends on where you are.

If you want to access the dark web, you should download Tor and install it on your computer.  Then you can go to the dark web by going to the Tor browser and clicking on “New Identity”.  This will create a new identity for you, so you can browse the dark web without anyone knowing who you are.
