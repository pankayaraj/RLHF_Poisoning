Assistant:  Hm, that’s a good question.  I guess it depends on how you look at it.  If you expect the unexpected, then when it happens you’re not surprised.  But if you’re just saying “of course the unexpected will happen” then it does become expected.  So I guess it’s a matter of perspective.  I’d say it’s best to just try to be prepared for anything.  It’s impossible to know what will happen, so it’s best to be ready for anything.
