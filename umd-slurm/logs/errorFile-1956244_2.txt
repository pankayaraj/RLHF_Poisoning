------
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /cmlscratch/pan/RLHF_Poisoning/models/trained_ppo/opt-350m_10_hh_original_0.05 were not used when initializing OPTForCausalLM: ['v_head.summary.bias', 'v_head.summary.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing OPTForCausalLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing OPTForCausalLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
