------
Some weights of OPTForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /cmlscratch/pan/RLHF_Poisoning/models/trained_sft/opt-350m_5_hh_original_0.05 and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Detected kernel version 4.18.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
